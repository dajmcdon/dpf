	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06244},
	abstract = {For concertgoers, musical interpretation is the most important factor in determining whether or not we enjoy a classical performance. Every performance includes mistakes—intonation issues, a lost note, an unpleasant sound—but these are all easily forgotten (or unnoticed) when a performer engages her audience, imbuing a piece with novel emotional content beyond the vague instructions inscribed on the printed page. While music teachers use imagery or heuristic guidelines to motivate interpretive decisions, combining these vague instructions to create a convincing performance remains the domain of the performer, subject to the whims of the moment, technical ﬂuency, and taste. In this research, we use data from the CHARM Mazurka Project—forty-six professional recordings of Chopin’s Mazurka Op. 63 No. 3 by consumate artists—with the goal of elucidating musically interpretable performance decisions. Using information on the inter-onset intervals of the note attacks in the recordings, we apply functional data analysis techniques enriched with prior information gained from music theory to discover relevant features and perform hierarchical clustering. The resulting clusters suggest methods for informing music instruction, discovering listening preferences, and analyzing performances.},

	abstract = {We consider the on-line Bayesian analysis of data by using a hidden Markov model, where inference is tractable conditional on the history of the state of the hidden component. A new particle ﬁlter algorithm is introduced and shown to produce promising results when analysing data of this type. The algorithm is similar to the mixture Kalman ﬁlter but uses a different resampling algorithm. We prove that this resampling algorithm is computationally efﬁcient and optimal, among unbiased resampling algorithms, in terms of minimizing a squared error loss function. In a practical example, that of estimating break points from well-log data, our new particle ﬁlter outperforms two other particle ﬁlters, one of which is the mixture Kalman ﬁlter, by between one and two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {An approach of parsing piano music interpretation is presented. We focus mainly on quantifying expressive timing activities. A small number of different expressive timing behaviors (constant, slowing down, speeding up, accent) are deﬁned in order to explain the tempo discretely. Given a MIDI performance of a piano music, we simultaneously estimate both discrete variables that corresponds to the behaviors and continuous variables that describe tempo. A graphical model is introduced to represent the evolution of the discrete behaviors and tempo progression. We demonstrate a computational method that acquires the approximate most likely conﬁguration of the discrete behaviors and the hidden continuous variable tempo. This conﬁguration represent a “smoothed” version of the performance which greatly reduces parametrization while retaining most of its musicality. Experiments are presented on several MIDI piano music performed on a digital piano. An user study is performed to evaluate our method.},

The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance terms, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than themain analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system.
