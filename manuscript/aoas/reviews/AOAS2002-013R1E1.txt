musical interpretation,"

Abstract, l.-5: "we learn a switching state space model ..."
Seems to me that you have started with assuming a switching
state model, and what you really do in the MS is "model a
musician's tempo via a Markov-switching state-space model,
and estimate its parameters using prior information, and
then cluster musicians via hierarchical clustering of model
parameters." Is that correct? (See p4, para 3, l.3-4.) If 
so, then you can say so directly, more succinctly, and more 
clearly.  (In my view, the verb "learn" has been grossly 
overused - and often improperly used - in the stat literature.)

"The resulting clusters suggest methods for informing music 
instruction, discovering listening preferences, and analyzing 
performances."  I hope you will say how the clusters do this.
Perhaps a music student might identify more with musicians in
Cluster A and hence study them more, is that what you have in
mind?  

p3, Fig 1: How desperately do you need color, here and in your
subsequent figures? Color is very expensive to print, and AOAS,
like many journals, ask authors to use it only when essential
for accurate reader comprehension.  You may need it in Fig 9
but perhaps gray scales and shadings will work for Fig 10-11.
We appreciate your attention to this cost-saving measure.

p3, para 2, l.-2: "learn": "understand"? "characterize"?

p4, l.-8: "learning" -> "estimating"?

p5, l.5-6:
   "There is an important modeling difference between these 
    approaches and what we propose."
->
   "We emphasize an important modeling difference between these
    approaches and our proposed model."

p5, Sec 1.2, l.6: "learned" -> delete altogether? or
"derived" or "estimated"?

p5, Sec 1.2, para 2 l.3: "it's" (it is) -> "its" (possessive)
also p6, l.1.  Please proofread carefully.

p6, l.1 below (1): 
"marginally independent and identically distributed as well as mutually independent"
Per (2), $\epsilon_i$ and $\eta_i$ are NOT "identically distributed." Hence change to:
"marginally and mutually independent and Gaussian distributed (see Eqn (2))"

p6, l.-13: delete "," after "filter"

p6, l.-9: "While" implies a time element.  Maybe you mean "Although"?

p6, l.-9: "the the" Please proofread carefully.

p6, l.-5: "There are many different smoother algorithms tailored"
-> "Many different smoother algorithms have been tailored"

p6, l.-2: Do you "lose" anything with this smoother that "produces only 
the unconditional expectations"?  Is it more realistic or useful to focus
on only the unconditional, rather than conditional expectations? (It makes
sense to me but perhaps a Bayesian might see it otherwise?)

p7, l.-15: "An excellent overview of the history, typography, and 
algorithmic developments can be found in (Ghahramani and Hinton, 2000)."
->
"Ghahramani and Hinton (2000) provide an excellent overview of the history, 
typography, and algorithmic developments."

p7, l.-3: "parameter matrices" ? Do you refer to the covariance matrices?

p9, para 2, l.-1: "small number of discrete states":
"small" arises from the assumption on p8, l.-4: "performers generally
maintain (or try to maintain) a steady tempo"? Or might one argue that
this assumption might be reasonable for Chopin or 18-19thC composers?
(Stravinsky doesn't seem very "steady" to me, but I'm not a musician!)

p9, l.-6: "we only allow certain" -> "we allow only certain"
("only" goes closest to the word it modifies; here, presumably,
"certain transitions" not "allow").

p10, para 2, l.1: "data gives" : cf. p5, Sec 2, l.2: "data are", but 
later on l.8: "data ... which includes".  Chose singular or plural
and be consistent.

p10, l.-6 to -3: "We use ... notes." -> "Because each measure contains 
three quarter notes, we use $\ell_i$ to denote ..., 1/6, etc."

p11, l.-3: "want to be able" -> "wish"

p12, l.-8: "learn"? Or "estimate from data"?  You have a model for these parameters.
See your own use of "estimate" only 5 lines later (l.-3).

p13, para 1, l.-3: "procedure of (Fearnhead and Clifford, 2003)"
-> "procedure of Fearnhead and Clifford (2003)"

p13, para 1, l.-2: "approximate to": delete "to"

p14, l.-5: "learned from the model"? or "resulting from the model fitting"?

p15, l.1: "The generative model in (Gu and Raphael, 2012)" ->
  "The generative model in Gu and Raphael (2012)"

p17, l.11: "performer ... on their own" -> "performer ... on her own"

p17, l.13-14: "how our model learns interpretive decisions"
 -> "interpretive decisions arising from our model" ??

p17, last para, l.1: "In terms of our model," -> "Our model suggests that" ??

p18, Table 4: Do we need SEs on these parameters?  Which parameters are
most meaningful in characterizing a performer?  If you were able to narrow
the number down from 12 to, say, 3 linear combinations of the 12 (say, via
PC?), could you plot them, and show visually how much of an outlier Cortot is?

p18, l.-14: "takeaways" -> "messages" (less colloquial)

p18, l.-14: "Itâ€™s easy to see the increased variability ..." 
May not be so "easy" for some to see, so perhaps:
"The variability definitely increases ..."

p24, Sec 3.5: Any ideas how to modify the model to incorporate these
limitations?  (The ideas can be left as "Future work.")

p24, l.-4: "an acceleration could be learned" -> "an acceleration
parameter could be incorporated into the model and estimated"

p24, l.-1: "Or course" ?? "Of course" ??  (Please proofread carefully.)

p26, l.-6: "other had" -> "other hand" ?  (Please proofread carefully.)

p26, l.-2: "On the other hand" again??  Maybe just "Or,"
