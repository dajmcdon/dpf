AOAS2002-013, "Mardov-switching state space models for uncovering
musical interpretation,"
Daniel J MacDonald, Michael McBride, Yupeng Gu, Christopher Raphael


This article presents an application of Markov-switching state space 
models to music data. In particular, the specific focus is on 
characterizing variation among performers playing Chopin Mazurkas. 
The models considered and statistical estimation algorithms are 
quite old and standard at this point. In addition, there is 
seemingly no formal consideration of modeling of variation among 
performers - for example, in the clustering analysis the model 
was fitted separately for each performer and then the estimated 
parameters were fed into a clustering algorithm.

More importantly, it is not at all clear that the results produced 
are very interesting from a musical perspective. I consulted a 
musician colleague in considering this paper and he/she thought that 
there was nothing interesting produced by the output of this procedure. 
Of course people vary in their performance - this may be due to a 
shared instructor, influence by a previous famous recording etc. 
My colleague didn't think it was clear that this approach was 
actually a useful aid to musical education or interpretation of 
how individual performers interpret a piece. He/she mentioned it 
would be much more interesting to attempt to decide what variations 
in interpretation and performances are more compelling to the 
listener (among other possibilities). Indeed, to me the authors 
do not demonstrate the utility of their approach in this 
application - the paper is mostly descriptive.
