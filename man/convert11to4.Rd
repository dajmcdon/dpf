\title{Converts from the expanded eleven-state notation to four-state notation}
\usage{
convert11to4(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path in ten-state form}
}
\value{
path in four-state form
}
\description{
Because our model is actually 2-Markov, we expand from 4 to 16 states. 
But not all states can be visited, so there are only 11.
}
\examples{
path = sample(0:10, 25, replace=TRUE)
npath = convert10to4(path)

}
